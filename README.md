# Car Selling Price Prediction

Welcome to the **Car Selling Price Prediction** repository! This project is designed to showcase a machine learning model that predicts the selling price of cars based on various features. The project employs Linear Regression to build the predictive model.

## Project Overview

In this project, the goal is to predict the selling price of cars using a set of features such as the car's year of manufacture, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and more. The dataset used for this project, "car_data.csv," (data taken from kaggle) includes information about various cars and their corresponding selling prices. By analyzing this data and building a predictive model, we aim to accurately estimate the selling price of cars based on their attributes.

## Project Structure

The repository comprises the following key components:

- `car_data.csv`: This CSV file contains the dataset used for training and testing the predictive model. It includes various features related to cars and their corresponding selling prices.

- `prize_prediction.ipynb`: This Python script contains the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, training a Linear Regression model, and making predictions. It also calculates the R-squared error score to assess the model's performance.

- `README.md`: This README file provides a concise overview of the project, its objectives, and instructions for running the code. It explains the dataset, the approach taken to predict selling prices, and how to interpret the results.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have Python and the required libraries installed (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn).
3. Run the `main.py` script using a Python interpreter. This script will load and preprocess the data, train the Linear Regression model, and display the R-squared error score and a scatter plot of predicted vs. actual selling prices.

## Results

Upon running the script, you will see the R-squared error score, which provides insight into how well the model fits the data. The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between actual and predicted selling prices, allowing you to assess the model's performance graphically.

## Note

This project serves as an introductory example of using machine learning for predicting car selling prices. You can further enhance the project by experimenting with different algorithms, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning.

Feel free to explore the code, run the example, and contribute to the project by improving the model's accuracy or adding more features.
